The same year that we first started sourcing from another of his farms, he acquired Finca La Guitarra. It is named for the lianas, woody vines found in heavily forested tropical areas, that are suspended all over the canopy and resemble guitar strings. Finca La Guitarra is tucked away in a steep valley surrounded by steep mountains and is planted with mostly San Ramon and Caturra trees. San Ramon is a dwarf descendant of Typica and produces less fruit when compared to other coffees with Typica lineages.",
