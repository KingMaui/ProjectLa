          <h2>Store</h2>
          <strong>Concept:</strong>
          <p>An international e-commerce platform dedicated to delivering authentic US products to customers overseas, with a focus on markets such as China, Japan, Korea and Singapore. During my travels to these regions, I noticed a strong demand for American brands, particularly in lifestyle and premium product categories.</p>
          <p>Currently, my primary focus is the coffee market, as coffee culture is rapidly gaining popularity in metropolitan areas like Tokyo and Seoul. Being based in San Francisco, a hub for coffee innovation. This gives me a unique advantage in sourcing and curating high-quality coffee beans to share with overseas coffee enthusiasts.</p>
          <p>As the store grows, I plan to expand into additional categories, offering a wider range of well-known American brands to share with the world. </p>

          <h2>Habit</h2>
          <strong>Concept:</strong>

The tracker lets you reset your streak whenever you break a habit, keeping you accountable and motivated. It also provides detailed insights, including the total number of resets and the average time between streaks, so you can better understand your progress and patterns. </p>
          <br>
